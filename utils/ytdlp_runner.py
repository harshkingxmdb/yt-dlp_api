"""Shared `yt-dlp -g` runner — the fallback for when the Innertube fast path can't resolve.

Anonymous FIRST, cookies only as a second attempt, because on YouTube today cookies
make ordinary videos *worse*, not better (all three measured on a normal video):
  * no cookies                        -> resolves fine
  * cookies + yt-dlp's default client -> "The page needs to be reloaded."
  * cookies + mweb (the only client   -> https formats need a GVS PO token, so
    that accepts cookies)                adaptive audio is dropped; 360p muxed survives

Cookies still earn their place on age-gated / members-only videos, which no
anonymous client can reach — so they run as a retry, not as the default. The retry
also relaxes the format selector, since the cookie-accepting client often offers
only the muxed stream and a hard selector would fail outright.

Both extraction call sites (cache_manager, media_extractor) route through here so
the client/cookie policy lives in exactly one place.
